## User Preferences
I prefer detailed explanations. Ask before making major changes. I want iterative development. I prefer simple language. I like functional programming.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend is built with React + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, and shadcn/ui components. It uses Inter for UI text and JetBrains Mono for code/URLs. The color scheme is a professional dashboard with a blue primary accent, and it supports a dark mode.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, TanStack Query, Recharts.
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon) with Drizzle ORM.
- **Scheduling**: node-cron with CST timezone support for automated jobs.
- **Data Ingestion**: Handles bulk CSV/XLSX imports for locations, keywords, rankings, and projects.
- **Priority Classification**: Keywords are automatically tiered into P1 (High), P2 (Medium), and P3 (Low) based on intent and current ranking.
- **Automated Crawl Schedules**: Predefined schedules for keyword rankings (3x weekly), page metrics (4x weekly), and competitor analysis (2x weekly).

### Feature Specifications

Formula: For keywords where competitors rank in top 20, calculates positionScore = (21 - competitorPos) / 20, gapFactor based on our ranking position (or 1.0 if not ranking), and aggregates threatScore = volume × positionScore × gapFactor. Final index is normalized to 0-100 scale.
